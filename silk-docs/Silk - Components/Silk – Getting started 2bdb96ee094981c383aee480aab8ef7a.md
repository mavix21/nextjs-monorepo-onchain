# Silk – Getting started

Note that commercial use of Silk requires a commercial license. More information on the website: [silkhq.com](https://silkhq.com/).

# Install the package

To get started with Silk, install its npm package using your terminal.

```bash
npm install @silk-hq/components
```

# Import the styles

Silk makes use of low-level styles that must be imported into your project.

For convenience and flexibility, these styles are available in two versions: unlayered and layered. The layered version wraps Silk’s default styles into a CSS `@layer {}`.

## Basic

In a project that doesn’t make use of CSS layers, it is best to use the unlayered version. You can import it in different ways:

### Import into a CSS file

You can import the styles directly into your global CSS file.

```css
/* ./global.css */

@import "@silk-hq/components/unlayered-styles";
```

- **With the `.css` extension**
  You can also do this using the `.css` extension, which some build tools require.
  ```css
  /* ./global.css */

  @import "@silk-hq/components/unlayered-styles.css";
  ```

### Import into a JavaScript file

You can also import the styles in a JavaScript or TypeScript file at the root of your project.

```jsx
// ./index.js

import "@silk-hq/components/unlayered-styles";
```

- **With the `.css` extension**
  You can also do this using the `.css` extension, which some build tools require.
  ```jsx
  // ./index.js

  import "@silk-hq/components/unlayered-styles.css";
  ```

## In a project using CSS layers (e.g. Tailwind V4)

In a project that makes use of CSS layers (e.g. using Tailwind V4), you can use both the unlayered and the layered version. In any case, Silk’s layer declaration must occur before that of your normal styles. You can import it in different ways:

### Import into a CSS file

- You can import the **unlayered styles** into a layer directly into your global CSS, before your normal styles.

```css
/* ./global.css */

@import "@silk-hq/components/unlayered-styles" layer(silk);
/* @import "tailwindcss"; */
```

- **With the `.css` extension**
  You can also do this using the `.css` extension, which some build tools require.
  ```css
  /* ./global.css */

  @import "@silk-hq/components/unlayered-styles.css" layer(silk);
  /* @import "tailwindcss"; */
  ```

📌

**Important note**: Some frameworks (e.g. Next.js, TanStack Start) have bugs surrounding layered imports. After installation, please check that Silk’s styles are indeed imported within a layer. If your framework fails to properly layer the styles, import layered styles directly, as explained below.

</aside>

- Or you can import the **layered styles** directly into your global CSS, before your normal styles. This is useful for framework that have issues with CSS layered imports (e.g. Next.js).

```css
/* ./global.css */

@import "@silk-hq/components/layered-styles";
/* @import "tailwindcss"; */
```

- **With the `.css` extension**
  You can also do this using the `.css` extension, which some build tools require.
  ```css
  /* ./global.css */

  @import "@silk-hq/components/layered-styles.css";
  /* @import "tailwindcss"; */
  ```

### Import into a JavaScript file

You can also import the layered styles in a JavaScript or TypeScript file at the root of your project, before importing any normal styles.

```jsx
/* ./index.js */

import "@silk-hq/components/layered-styles";
```

- **With the `.css` extension**
  You can also do this using the `.css` extension, which some build tools require.
  ```css
  /* ./index.js */

  import "@silk-hq/components/layered-styles.css";
  ```

# Import and use the components

You can now import the components that you want to use anywhere in your code.

Creating a bottom sheet component:

```tsx
// BottomSheet.tsx

import { Sheet } from "@silk-hq/components";

import "./BottomSheet.css";

const BottomSheet = () => (
  <Sheet.Root license="non-commercial">
    <Sheet.Trigger>Open</Sheet.Trigger>
    <Sheet.Portal>
      <Sheet.View className="BottomSheet-view" nativeEdgeSwipePrevention={true}>
        <Sheet.Backdrop themeColorDimming="auto" />
        <Sheet.Content className="BottomSheet-content">
          <Sheet.BleedingBackground className="BottomSheet-bleedingBackground" />
          Some content
        </Sheet.Content>
      </Sheet.View>
    </Sheet.Portal>
  </Sheet.Root>
);

export { BottomSheet };
```

```css
/* BottomSheet.css */

.BottomSheet-view {
  height: var(--silk-100-lvh-dvh-pct);
}

.BottomSheet-content {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  max-width: 700px;
  padding-block: 25vh;
  text-align: center;
}

.BottomSheet-bleedingBackground {
  border-radius: 24px;
  background-color: white;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 2px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
}
```

Using the bottom sheet:

```tsx
// Home.tsx

import { BottomSheet } from "./BottomSheet/BottomSheet";

export default function Home() {
  return <BottomSheet />;
}
```

This is what you should see:
